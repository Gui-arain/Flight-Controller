# Future developments

 This flight controller is a first version and we want to add some hardware upgrades in the future

## Sensor Suite

 We in the future we might want to add other sensors and integrate them into the PCB design. We detail here the different sensors we want to add by order of priority

### 🧭 IMU

 Another IMU could help improve the inertial odometry precision by using sensor fusion techniques

 We think the *BMI088* would be best suited and complementary with our current *ICM-42688-P* IMU  
 It indeed has:
 - a robust and reliable design
 - good mechanical filtering
 - a higher maximum acceleration limit $(24g)$

### 🧲 Magnometer
